# Jamtri, an idiot with talent

Hey.

I'm that dingbat you think of when your brain imagines "furries with jobs". Aside from the artists, of course.

I'm a 3D rendering and texture artist who's been following this passion for about a year now; I started with simple renders based around Roblox characters back in May of 2020, and have since grown to much more than unusually smooth LEGO people. To be fair with whoever is reading this, I don't even know if I should be here. As far as I know, GitHub is a platform for software developers and I am *far* from being one.'

I also have a quite unhealthy addiction to Geometry Dash.


### Tools of the Trade

- **Blender**

Blender is a free and open-source 3D utility that spans across pretty much all forms of 3D art, from modeling to sculpting to UV mapping to texture painting to whatever else you may be able to think of. I utilized Blender as my primary 3D software until the Christmas of 2020.


- **Cinema 4D**

Cinema 4D is a 3D tool suite created by MAXON that is marketed towards professional VFX and rendering. While it is much more powerful in Blender in terms of the fields it does specialize in, it is very lacking in other fields, such as sculpting and UV. Cinema 4D is my current primary 3D software along with Octane Render in conjunction; I've been using it since Christmas 2020.


- **Octane Render**

Octane Render is an unbiased GPU-based 3D render engine created by OTOY for professional 3D software such as Cinema 4D, Autodesk Maya/3DS Max, etc. It has proven itself to be one of, if not the best GPU-based render engines in the world, being able to utilize RTX acceleration very well. Octane Render is my current primary render engine, being used in conjunction with Cinema 4D since Christmas 2020.


- **Substance Painter**

Substance Painter is a 3D UV and texturing tool created by Allegorithmic (now owned by Adobe) and is primary used for the applying of physically-based textures and materials to 3D assets for shipment to studios. Substance Painter is my current primary texturing software.
